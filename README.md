With the exponential growth of heterogeneous data across distributed information systems (IS) and the 
influx of raw data with description, organizations emphasized building virtual systems dealing with data 
silos across multiple data sources ranging from structured relational databases to unstructured text. 
Traditional data integration methods face scalability, freshness, and interoperability limitations. We 
propose a Federated Semantic Knowledge Lake (FSKL) framework built upon Ontology-Based Data Access 
(OBDA) and the FedX federation engine, enabling real-time integration and seamless interoperability 
across heterogeneous healthcare IS without requiring centralized data migration. The framework 
establishes semantic data pipelines for unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data sources, 
transforming them into ontological knowledge graphs. As a result, these are integrated into a Federated 
Virtual Knowledge Graph (FVKG) to enable seamless, real-time data access using SPARQL endpoints. The 
proposed Knowledge-Graph-as-a-Platform (KGaaP) resolves semantic interoperability and supports 
service-oriented healthcare applications through SPARQL-based federated querying, promoting dynamic, 
scalable, and interoperable data ecosystems.
